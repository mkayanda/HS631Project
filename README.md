We were presented with a dataset of 1000 observations and 14 variables as outlined in the summary below. The goal of the analysis was to summarize and interpret the dataset performing data cleaning, explanatory data analysis. We were also required to fit a final linear model with birth weight as a function of predictor variables as well as a final logistic regression model with low birth weight as a function of the given variables.
